A simple Calculator Single Page Web App built Using Express, Node.js, Bootstrap and Angular 

To run the calculator web app, simply clone this repository to an empty folder and run: "npm install" in order to install all the node dependancies. 

Then, from the root directory of that folder run: "node server.js" to start the web app. Go to: http://localhost:3000/ to view the calculator application in action.

You can also view the calculator app in Heroku at: https://angular-simple-calculator.herokuapp.com/
